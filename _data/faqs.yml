faq:
  - question: When is the right time for a founder to reach out to you?
    answer: It's never too early for founders to reach out to us. We frequently
      start talking to founders when they are still employed, working on an
      idea, looking for a co-founder, or building a minimum viable product
      (MVP). And we often invest before a product or revenue is generated.
  - question: Do you lead investment rounds, or do you co-invest with other VCs?
    answer: We are often the first to back a startup. We do that unconditionally,
      and typically before a lead VC. We then introduce the founders we back to
      other investors, VCs and angels.
  - question: How much do you usually invest in one round?
    answer: We invest between $150k and $250k in each round, and can often invest
      more in collaboration with our investors/limited partners. We are also
      able to provide follow-on investments.
  - question: How do you help founders?
    answer: We invest capital and make beneficial introductions to the founders we
      back, namely to angels, VCs and corporate clients (typically Private
      Equity owned enterprises).
  - question: In which sectors do you invest?
    answer: We are sector agnostic.
