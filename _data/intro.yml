  <h2>Breaking out requires breaking away from labels. </h2>
  <p>Great entrepreneurs know this. Many have been misunderstood early on. They learned to reinvent themselves and to update their beliefs about the world. Quickly and often.</p>

  <p>At No Label Ventures, we back epic immigrant entrepreneurs.</p>

  <h2>Why Immigration?</h2>

  <p>Because uprooting your life is the purest entrepreneurial act: risk everything, rebuild from zero, bet on yourself. And long before you pack a suitcase, you've outgrown the labels assigned at your own dinner table: play it safe, know your place. </p>

  <p>It breeds uncommon advantages: the humility of starting at the bottom, the determination to learn and adapt fast, and the conviction to ignore inherited labels. It is no surprise, then, that immigrants account for ~50% of US and ~40% of UK unicorns (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7001491725886103553/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>).</p>

  <p>No Label exists to spot and supercharge that talent before the rest of the market catches up.</p>
