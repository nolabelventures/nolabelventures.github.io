  Ventures, we back immigrant entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Why immigrants?</p>
  <p>Because uprooting your life is the purest entrepreneurial act, you risk
  everything, rebuild from zero, bet on yourself. And because long before that
  suitcase was packed, you had already broken free of the labels assigned at
  your dinner table: *play it safe, know your place*.</p> <p>Immigration breeds
  uncommon advantages: the humility of starting at the bottom, the determination
  to learn and grow fast, and the conviction to ignore inherited labels. It is
  no surprise, then, that immigrants account for \\~50% of US and \\~40% of UK
