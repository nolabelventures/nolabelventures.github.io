  No Label Ventures, backs immigrant entrepreneurs.


  Why immigrants?  


  Because uprooting your life is the purest entrepreneurial act, you risk everything, rebuild from zero, bet on yourself. And because long before that suitcase was packed, you had already broken free of the labels assigned at your dinner table: *play it safe, know your place*.  


  Immigration breeds uncommon advantages: the humility of starting at the bottom, the determination to learn and grow fast, and the conviction to ignore inherited labels. It is no surprise, then, that immigrants account for \~50% of US and \~40% of UK unicorns ([link](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7001491725886103553)).  


  No Label exists to spot and supercharge that talent before the market catches up.
